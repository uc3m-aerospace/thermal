# Thermal mathematical model (TMM) set up helper function.

OUTPUT:

This function returns a structure with 

* node properties
* conduction links
* radiative links

All units are SI units.

Initial temperatures and thermal loads (internal and external) are
scenario-specific, and are not contained in this structure. They are
generated by the companion function `thermal_scenario`.

This function can be used as a template when creating the TMM of a new
system. 
Since the model structure is just that (a structure), it can
be created by other means than with this model function.
