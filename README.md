# Thermal

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/256158417.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/256158417)

> A simple code for approximate thermal mathematical modeling and simulation.

This set of Matlab package allows modeling and simulating the thermal evolution of a system
composed of several isothermal nodes, connected by conductive paths and radiative paths, 
subject to internal and external heat loads, and radiating to free space. All units are SI units.

This code has been developed as an aid for the Spacecraft Predesign course of the Master in
Space Engineering at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. It is currently in beta version
and may contain errors. All help to detect bugs and improve the code is welcome.


## Installation

Installation requires simply that you
[download Thermal](https://github.com/uc3m-aerospace/thermal/archive/master.zip)
and add the base `src` directory (the one that contains the `+thermal` directory)
to your Matlab path.

### Dependencies

A recent version of Matlab is needed to run the code.

## Quick usage guide

The main function that the user must know is `thermal.integrator`. This function uses ode45
to integrate the thermal evolution equation of each node. It has the following interface:

```matlab
function [t,T] = integrator(model,scenario,tspan,options)
```

where the INPUTS are:

* `model` is a structure like the one generated by the function `model_template`. 
It contains the parameters of the thermal mathematical model to be simulated. 
The user is adviced to copy and edit this template to suit his/her needs.
* `scenario` is a structure like the one generated by the function `scenario_template`. 
This structure contains the initial conditions and thermal loads for the simulation.
The user is adviced to copy and edit this template to suit his/her needs.
* `tspan` is the time span for the simulation, e.g. [0,1000] s.
* `options` is an optional argument, a structure like the one generated by Matlab's `odeset` function.
A minimum absolute and relative tolerance should be indicated in `options` to ensure accurate integration.

where the OUTPUTS are:

* `t` is a `m x 1`-vector with the resulting integration times
* `T` is a `m x n`-array with the resulting integration temperatures, one column per node.

### Code structure

The package contains the following functions in the `/src` directory:

* `thermal.dT_dt`: differential equations for each node.
* `thermal.integrator`: main function to be called by the user. Integrates the differential equations.
* `model_template`: a function that generates the `model` structure. This is a template, intended to be copied and modified by the user.
* `scenario_template`: a function that generates the `scenario` structure. This is a template, intended to be copied and modified by the user.

### Testing

The test suite of the refactored version of Thermal is still quite minimal.
Tests and their fixtures can be found in the `/tests` directory. These tests can give you a feeling of how to run Thermal on your own.
After adding the Thermal package to your Matlab path, you can run all tests by executing `runtests` from the `/tests` directory.
